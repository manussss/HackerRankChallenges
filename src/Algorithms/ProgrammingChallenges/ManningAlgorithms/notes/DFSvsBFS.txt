| Uses stack (implicit or explicit)                | Uses queue                                              |
| Ideal for exhaustive searches or solving puzzles | Ideal for shortest path problems                        |
| Can consume less memory in tree traversal        | Can be more memory-intensive, especially in wide graphs |
